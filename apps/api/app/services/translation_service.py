"""LLM-backed fallback translation for call transcripts.

Used only when the client's on-device Chrome Translator API is unavailable
or doesn't support the requested language pair (see
frontend/src/lib/chrome-translation.ts). Stateless — the result is computed
and returned, never persisted.

Provider selection reuses apps.providers.one_shot_llm — the same
"which LLM is this org actually configured to use" check GET /configuration/llm
uses. An org must configure its own LLM provider via /integrations; there is
no shared server-wide fallback key — if no provider is configured (and no
local self-hosted model-server is reachable), translation fails with a clear
error rather than silently using a shared credential.

# in tokens, and BPE tokenizers split Devanagari/Tamil/etc. far more finely
# than Latin (commonly ~1 char/token vs Latin's ~4). Sizing this from an
# average or from Latin-only throughput silently truncates most Indic-target
# translations of a full-length transcript — exactly the unfixable-retry
# failure this cap exists to prevent, and the common case for this product's
# audience, not an edge case. So: assume 1 char of input can produce up to 1
# output token (the worst case across scripts we serve), plus fixed headroom
# for the occasional bracketed [note: ...] the model appends to garbled
# lines. Must stay ahead of MAX_TRANSCRIPT_CHARS's worst-case token-
# equivalent, or completions get silently truncated mid-transcript and
# _count_transcript_lines() rejects the result with an error that a retry
